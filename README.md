I had to reduce the Questions and Tags data size to make this code run on my system. I tried to run the code using the entire data set, however the activity is taking too long and my current laptop config probably not supporting the large data set. I have added screenshots for the same. Also I have split the  stackoverflow_tag_model_pytorch_1.pt file into 5  parts since GitHub wasn't allowing me to upload the entire 125MB file in one go.
